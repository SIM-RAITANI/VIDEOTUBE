mongoose-aggregate-paginate:
Pagination is the process of dividing a large set of data into smaller, manageable chunks or pages. Instead of showing all the data at once, it displays a limited number of items on each page. This makes it easier for users to find and navigate through the information, like flipping through pages in a book.
